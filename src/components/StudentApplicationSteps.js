      Before we can consider your application, you will need to complete our
      course prerequisites. We encourage applicants to take as much time as they
      need to work through the material and to support each other during the
      preparation process, both online and through our meetups.
      <br />
      <br />
      Please read our course prerequisites (see section below) carefully before
      planning when to apply.

        If you submit your application before the deadline, keep working on the
        prerequisites and tidying up your website. We will evaluate your
        progress as of the date the window closes.
